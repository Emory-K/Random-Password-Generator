# Random-Password-Generator
This code creates a list of characters(upper and lower), digits, and special characters.
A for loop will go from 0 to the number you've entered and grab a random item from each list in order.
To ensure that it's randomized enough, I used "random.shuffle" on the new list before returning it.
This project also includes input validation along with turning any negative input positive to make sure we can't break it with a simple typo.
password_maker is my first github project so I hope it's helpful to someone.
